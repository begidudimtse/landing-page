Palindrome Checker

This is a simple web-based application that allows users to check whether a given text is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

🚀 Demo
You can try the live demo of the Palindrome Checker by opening the index.html file in your web browser.

📂 Project Structure
index.html - The main HTML file.

styles.css - The CSS file for styling the page.

script.js - The JavaScript file that handles the palindrome check logic.

💡 Features
Simple, clean, and responsive design.

Allows users to input text and instantly check if it is a palindrome.

Ignores spaces, punctuation, and capitalization when checking.

Displays a clear message indicating whether the input is a palindrome.

⚡ How It Works
Users enter text in the input field.

When the "Check" button is pressed:

The text is trimmed (extra spaces removed).

Special characters and spaces are ignored.

The text is compared to its reversed version.

If both are the same, it is a palindrome; otherwise, it is not.
